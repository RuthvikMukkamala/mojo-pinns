I am building Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in Mojo with enhancements for PyTorch functionality. I hope to demostrate that using Mojo and MAX we can outperform 
similar models on the CPU since most training is done on the GPU. To do this project I am extremeley grateful to the Mojo team and the MAX team and the creators of Physics Informed Neural Networks - @rezaakb and @maziarraissi. The inspiration for this project came from the paper, https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BPFzolSSrI

Here are the steps for the project with tentative deadlines.
  - Week 1: Research and Design
    - Understand the PINNs paper and MAX Engine w/ Training 
    - Develop a basic understanding of the Mojo and MAX libraries
    - Develop a basic understanding of PyTorch
  - Week 2: Implement a basic PINNs model in PyTorch
  - Week 3: Implement a basic PINNs model in Mojo
  - Week 4: Train the PINNs model in Mojo
  - Week 5: Evaluate the PINNs model in Mojo
  - Week 6: Benchmark the PINNs model in Mojo against PyTorch
